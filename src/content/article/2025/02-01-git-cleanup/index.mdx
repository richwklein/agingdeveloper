## The Power and Messiness of Git

Git is the backbone of modern software development, providing a powerful way to track, manage, and collaborate on code. Whether you're working solo on a passion project, contributing to open-source, or juggling multiple enterprise repositories, Git keeps everything versioned and organized. Like many developers, I use Git both at work and for personal projects. This site is developed using Git and hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/richwklein/agingdeveloper).

But let's be honest—Git repositories can get messy. Old stashes, merged-but-forgotten branches, and lingering references accumulate, making it harder to navigate and manage your work efficiently.

To tackle this problem, I built [git-cleanup](http://github.com/richwklein/git-cleanup), a lightweight _bash_ script designed to keep your repositories neat and clutter-free. It automates the removal of outdated references, so you can focus on writing great code instead of cleaning up after yourself.

## Why Git Repositories Get Messy

Over time, repositories accumulate digital debris that can slow you down. Here's what typically happens:

- **Forgotten Stashes**: Stashed changes often get left behind, creating unnecessary clutter.
- **Merged but Undeleted Branches**: Once a branch is merged, it's easy to forget about it.
- **Detached References**: Temporary commit references linger longer than they should.
- **Multiple Repositories**: If you manage multiple projects, keeping everything tidy can be overwhelming.

If you're like me, all your repositories probably live in a single `projects` directory, and manually cleaning them up is not how you want to spend your time.

## Automating the Cleanup Process

The `git-cleanup` script automates this tedious process by removing unnecessary references in your Git repositories. It will:

- Fetch updates from remote repositories and prunes any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote.
- Remove local branches that have been deleted on the remote.
- Remove local branches that have been merged into the main branch.
- Prune orphaned objects from the local repository.
- Check for old stashes and notifies if any are found.
- Optionally removes any untracked branches.

## How to Use It

You can run the script with the following options:

```sh
Usage: ./git_cleanup.sh [-d directory] [-u]
```

- -d directory: Specify the directory to clean up. Defaults to the current directory (.).
- -u: Removes untracked branches.

If the specified directory contains a _.git_ file, the script will clean up just that directory. This is useful when working in a specific project and you notice things have gotten unwieldy. Otherwise, the script will recurse into child directories to find and clean up any Git repositories.

## Making it easier with an Alias

Since I run this cleanup regularly, I made it even simpler with a shell alias. Adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file saves even more time:

```sh
alias cleanup="sh $PROJECTS/git-cleanup/git_cleanup.sh -d $PROJECTS"
```

The `$PROJECTS` is an environment variable that I have set to the directory containing all my projects. This alias will run the _git_cleanup.sh_ script from its checked-out location against the directory specified by `$PROJECTS`.

Now, cleaning all repositories is just one command away:

```sh
> cleanup
```

## Why I’m Sharing This

I know many developers have their own Git cleanup scripts, but I wanted to share mine in a structured, reusable format. \*git-cleanup\*\* is open-source, free to use, and available for anyone to enhance.

If you find it useful, give it a try and let me know how it works for you. You can also contribute improvements or suggestions on the [git-cleanup repository](http://github.com/richwklein/git-cleanup).

Keeping your Git environment clean doesn't have to be a hassle. Automate it once, and spend more time writing code instead of managing clutter.

Happy coding!
