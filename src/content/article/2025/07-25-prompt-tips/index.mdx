I'm not an expert when it comes to AI or prompt engineering, but I do use them in both my personal and professional life. I have learned a few things that worth sharing that can help you get better results from AI tools like ChatGPT.

Here are a few practical tips for crafting prompts that will help you get the best results out of AI chat tools:

## Give the AI a job title

When you start a prompt, try giving the AI a specific job title or role. This helps set the context and expectations for the response. For example, instead of just asking "What is the weather like?", you could say "You are a weather expert. What is the current weather in New York City?".

\*\*A handy mnemonic for crafting effective prompts is CARE, which reminds you to include:

    Context: the background or situation

    Ask: the specific action or request

    Rules: any constraints or guidelines

    Examples: sample inputs or outputs to illustrate what you want
