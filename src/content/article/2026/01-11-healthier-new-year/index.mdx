As a software engineer, staying healthy can be a real challenge. Long hours in front of a screen, the demands of deep focus, and the mental load of context-switching don't exactly lend themselves to great habits. Add in the complexity of working across time zones with a shortened lunch break, and it's easy to see why health often gets pushed aside.

In 2026, I'm trying to shift that. Not by doing anything extreme, but by making a few practical changes that feel sustainable. Here's how I'm approaching a healthier year without blowing up my workflow.

## The Morning Reset

Walking the dog has been part of my morning routine for a while, but this year I'm using that time more deliberately. Rather than rushing through it before logging on, I'm treating it as a mental reset — a chance to move, clear my head, and start the day with a bit of structure. It's too easy in this line of work to go straight from bed to desk, especially when early meetings creep into the schedule. Getting outside, even briefly, adds a kind of rhythm that helps me show up more grounded.

Lately, I've been using those walks to outline my day mentally. Just a bit of quiet movement and a rough plan forming in my head. It's like a mobile whiteboard session. That small pause helps cut through the noise and sets me up to start work more focused and less reactive.

## Standing Focus

I've had a standing desk for a couple of years, but I used it pretty inconsistently. Like a lot of engineers, I'd fall into long stretches of sitting; especially during meetings or deep work. This year, I'm using it more intentionally by building it into short, focused work sessions.

I'm leaning back into the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minute sprints with 5 minute breaks. During those breaks, I stand up, stretch, walk around, or switch my desk from sitting to standing (or vice versa). It's not a full workout, but those small posture changes act like a mental and physical reset. The standing desk isn't magic, but when paired with that kind of rhythm, it's helping me feel sharper and more alert.

## Mental Buffering

One thing I've been paying more attention to lately is the mental whiplash that comes from rapid context switching. Jumping from a coding session into a high stakes meeting then into async feedback can leave my brain scrambled. So I'm experimenting with small "mental buffers" between tasks to help reset my focus.

Sometimes that means taking a short walk around the house or stepping outside for two minutes of fresh air. Other times, I'll knock out a quick personal task (something simple like unloading the dishwasher). On especially packed days, I go for a quick win: a five-minute task I can complete and check off to reset my brain. These little transitions act like mental palate cleansers. They don't take much time, but they help me show up more focused for whatever comes next.

## Eating for Energy

One change that's already paying off is how I approach lunch. Since time is tight, I need meals that are fast, filling, and won't tank my focus. I've started putting protein at the center. It's something that helps me stay steady through the afternoon.

I'm not following a strict plan, just trying to be smarter about prep. I use my [myrecipes.com](https://www.myrecipes.com) account to collect high-protein recipes that are quick to prep or batch-friendly. That site makes it easy to save and organize the meals I want to eat. I'll occasionally scroll through on a slow weekend day and add a few more so I'm not defaulting to the same meals over and over. Having solid options has made post-lunch work easier to show up for.

## Cutting Back, Thinking Clearer

I've also been dialing back on alcohol. I'm not quitting altogether, but I've noticed that even one drink can mess with sleep — and sleep matters. Cutting back has made it easier to get to bed at a decent hour and feel clearer in the morning, which is a win I didn't fully expect.

The change isn't about restriction. It's about feeling more in control of my time and attention. The improvement isn't dramatic, but it's noticeable and worth sticking with.

## Final Thoughts on a Healthier 2026

Balancing health with a demanding software engineering role isn't easy, but it's possible with a few smart adjustments. These changes are about building habits that support how I want to feel and work. I'm optimistic that 2026 can be healthier, more focused, and just a bit more sustainable.
