Throughout my 20s I was an active participant online. I followed and worked on open source projects in the late 90s and early 2000s. When [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) (also know as the Social Web) started to take shape I was involved. My Space, Digg, Twitter, Facebook were all sites that I participated on fairly regularly along with my own blog.

As the online landscape shifted and my career and personal life evolved I found myself particpating online less and less frequently. My work become more enterprise focused and less available to the general public. I've got a family with 3 boys that keep me busy. I just didn't have the time, desire, or energy to spend a lot of time engaging in the general public. 

About a year ago I started to feel nostalgic for the level of engagement I had during those Web 2.0 years. I hadn't had any real active envolvement with the general public in years. My work was not something that most of the general public woudl see and I was rusty on the skill sets that had given me my career to begin with. It had been years that I had done any real front end development. 

At the same time I also started to realize I have a unique perspective. A lot of software development careers shift to management focus as you ascend the career track. I was an engineering manager for a while, but took a step back and decided that I wanted to stay focused on development. My real passion was building software and not managing people. So I changed career paths and went back to engineering. This means I'm now a forty something year old in an industry that is well known for [skewing towards youth](https://www.google.com/search?q=ageism+software+engineering&oq=ageism+software+engineering).

So that is what this site is about. It is a way for me to re-engage in the general public. Go back and learn what the latest trends are in front-end development. And share my perspective on what it is like being an aging developer. 

*Fair warning* As this site is my actively learning location it will be broken and have missing features for large portions of the time.
