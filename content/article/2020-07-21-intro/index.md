Throughout my 20s I was an active participant online. I followed and worked on 
open source projects in the late 90s and early 2000s. When 
[Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) (also know as the Social Web) 
started to take shape I was involved. My Space, Digg, Twitter, Facebook were all 
sites where I participated early on and fairly regularly along with publishing 
my own blog. I was in constant contact with a thriving online community. This 
was especially true when I was working at AOL on the 
[Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator_9) browser and 
[Propeller](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://propeller.com) social news site.

As the online landscape shifted and my career and personal life evolved, I 
found myself particpating online less and less frequently. My work became more 
enterprise focused and less available to the general public. I've got an active 
family life with a wonderful wife and 3 boys that keeps us busy. I just didn't 
have the time, desire, or energy to spend a lot of time engaging in the general 
public. 

About a year ago I started to feel nostalgic for the level of engagement I had 
during those earlier years. I hadn't had any real active involvement with the 
general public in years. My work is not something that most people would see and 
I was rusty on the skill sets that had given me my initial career path. It had 
been years since I had done any real front-end development. I not only wanted to 
go back to participating more, but I also wanted to do work that was seen again 
by a larger audience. 

At the same time I also started to realize that I have a unique perspective. A 
lot of software development careers shift to a management focus as you ascend 
the career track. I was a manager for a while, but I took a step back and decided 
that I wanted to stay focused on development and engineering. My real passion 
was building software and not managing people so I changed career paths and went 
back to development. This means I'm now a mid forty year old developer in an 
industry that is well known for 
[skewing towards youth](https://www.google.com/search?q=ageism+software+engineering&oq=ageism+software+engineering). This was an avenue I could explore and share my own personal experiences. 

This site will not be soley dedicated to this "Aging Developer" perspective, 
but it will color everything that I do with it. [The Aging Developer](/) is a 
vehicle for me to re-engage and actively participate more. It also provides a 
way for me to go back and learn the latest trends in front-end development.

**Fair warning**: The site is an active development and a learning location. It 
will be broken and have missing features for large portions of the time.
