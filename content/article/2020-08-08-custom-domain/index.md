[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a great service. It gets my workflow and I can't heap
enough praise on it. It provides a subdomain for your site to be hosted on by default.
This is great way to get started. At some point though your going to want to move
your site off to it's own domain. Making that change is not particularly hard,
and Netlify has [great documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/#configure-a-subdomain), but for those of us that have not worked much with 
DNS it can be intimidating. So this article will walk through an example of how 
to set this up.

In this example I'm going to assume you already have a domain registered. I
went and registered [agingdeveloper.net](https://agingdeveloper.net) as part
of this exercise just to remind myself how to do it. My 
[False Starts Article](/article/2020/07/26/false-start) explained how I had 
previously set up hosting and registered the domain agingdeveloper.com with 
[BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com). That is the registrar I'm going to be
using here. You may have to do something different with other registrars.
The screenshots are from setting up a second domain, They will look different 
then when setting up your first domain.

In Netlify go to your site's Settings â€º Domain management. Select 
*Add custom domain* at the bottom of the **Custom domains** panel, enter your 
domain name, and select *Verify*.

Confirm you are the owner of the domain then select *Yes, add domain*. 
We are going to choose to delegate the domain Netlify. Make a copy of 
Netlify's nameservers. These are listed directly below the custom domain panel. 

![Netlify Nameservers](netlify_nameservers.png)

On your Bluehost's domain page, select the domain that you want to delegate. 
Then select the *name servers* tab. Choose the option to 
*Use Custom Nameservers* and input the previously copied list.

Select *save nameserver settings*. It may take just a minute for the setting to 
take effect, but that is all you have to do. Your site should now show up
at the new domain name. Pretty easy, right!!!
